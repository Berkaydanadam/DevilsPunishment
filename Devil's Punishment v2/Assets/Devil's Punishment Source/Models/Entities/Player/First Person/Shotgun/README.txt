shotgun animations:

For the textures:
Ask papi for the shotgun textures, i dont have them on me :x
For the hands you can use the main character's textures (the ones in the .zip i sent w/ the character model)
the handcuffs textures arent done yet, apply any metal texture to it if you have one and it should look fine tho.

Dont hesitate to change the speed of certain animations if necessary, ex: speed x2 or x3 on the idle animation when walking, adjusting reload animations depending on the reload speed of the character ect.
