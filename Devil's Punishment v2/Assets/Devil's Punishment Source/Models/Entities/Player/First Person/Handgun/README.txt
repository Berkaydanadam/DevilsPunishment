dont forget to use the camera that is included in the .fbx file (if not make shure it s at the exact same place and angle) 


for the textures:
(same as always)
for the hands use the same material as the one for the main character and for the gun you ll have to contact papi.

animations:

frames		animation
0-15		pulls out gun
15-35		walking (change the speed of the animation to get the idle animation)
35-45		fire
45-95		reloading
95-105		transition from idle to aiming
105-115		fire while aiming
115-135		walking while aiming
135-145		transition from aiming to idle
145-160		removes gun from screen
