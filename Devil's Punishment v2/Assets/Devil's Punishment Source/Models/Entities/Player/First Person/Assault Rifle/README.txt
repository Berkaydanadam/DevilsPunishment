ANIMATIONS FOR FPS CHARACTER WITH ASSAULT RIFLE

-there are no textures on this pack, ask papi for the assault rifle s materials (i dont have them on me) and for the rest of the models they work with the same textures as the ones for the main character i gave earlier. (ps: the textures for the hancuffs will be changed in the future but for now use the ones the main character has)

-dont hesitate to change the animations speed if you need to :p

-There is a camera in the .fbx file, dont change it s location/rotation without moving the other objects, otherwise the player could look at spots he shouldnt be able to see.
